| `/exit`            | Exit the chat                               |

### Enhanced File Reading

The `/read` command now supports:
- Reading files from subdirectories (`/read data.csv` finds files in `.lobster_workspace/data/`)
- Absolute paths (`/read /Users/name/Desktop/file.csv`)
- Case-insensitive matching
- Detailed debug logging

## üîß Configuration

### Quick Setup

```bash
Read config/README_CONFIGURATION.md
```

In short: 
1. Populate .env file
This interactive command will help you set up:
- API keys (OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, NCBI)
- Model preferences
- Default settings

### Manual Setup

Create a `.env` file in your working directory:

```env
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
AWS_BEDROCK_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-key
AWS_BEDROCK_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret

# Optional
NCBI_API_KEY=your-ncbi-key
GENIE_PROFILE=production
```

### Interactive Chat Mode for debugging

```bash
lobster chat --reasoning --debug
```

### Single Query

```bash
lobster query "Download and analyze GSE109564 from GEO"
```

### With Custom Workspace

```bash
lobster chat --workspace ./my-analysis
```

# Streamlit

## local run
```bash
streamlit run lobster/streamlit_app.py
```

### Using Docker

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t lobster-ai:py313 .
docker run -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env lobster-ai:py313
```

## üí¨ Example Usage

```bash
ü¶û You: Download GSE109564 and perform quality control

ü¶û Lobster: I'll download GSE109564 and perform quality control analysis...

[Downloading GEO dataset...]
‚úì Downloaded GSE109564: 5,000 cells √ó 20,000 genes
‚úì Study: Single-cell RNA-seq of mouse neurons

[Performing quality control...]
‚úì Mitochondrial gene percentage: 5-15% (healthy range)
‚úì Gene counts per cell: 2,000-8,000 (good coverage)
‚úì Identified 523 low-quality cells for removal

[Visualizations created:]
- QC metrics violin plot
- Gene count distribution
- Mitochondrial percentage scatter plot

The data quality looks good overall. Would you like me to proceed with clustering?
```

# üß¨ Available Analyses

- **Data Download**: GEO datasets, CSV/H5 file uploads
- **Quality Control**: Cell/gene filtering, doublet detection
- **Clustering**: Leiden/Louvain algorithms, UMAP visualization
- **Cell Annotation**: Marker-based and reference-based methods
- **Differential Expression**: Between clusters or conditions
- **Pathway Analysis**: GO/KEGG enrichment
- **Literature Integration**: Find parameters and validation from PubMed

## üìä Export & Reproducibility

This creates a ZIP file containing:
- Raw and processed data
- All generated plots (interactive HTML + static PNG)
- Complete methodology report
- Tool parameters and timestamps

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Using Different Models

```bash
# Use Claude for complex analyses
export GENIE_PROFILE=high-performance
lobster chat

# Use lightweight models for quick tasks
export GENIE_PROFILE=cost-optimized
lobster chat
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from lobster import LobsterClient

client = LobsterClient()
result = client.query("Analyze my single-cell data for T cell markers")
print(result['response'])
```

## Deploy Streamlit to AWS fargate via CDK

Taken from [aws-examples repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/deploy-streamlit-app)

```bash
cdk bootstrap
cdk deploy
```

The deployment takes 5 to 10 minutes.

Make a note of the output, in which you will find the CloudFront distribution URL
and the Cognito user pool id.

4. Create a user in the Cognito UserPool that has been created. You can perform this action from your AWS Console. 
5. From your browser, connect to the CloudFront distribution url.
6. Log in to the Streamlit app with the user you have created in Cognito.

## Some limitations

* The connection between CloudFront and the ALB is in HTTP, not SSL encrypted.
This means traffic between CloudFront and the ALB is unencrypted.
It is **strongly recommended** to configure HTTPS by bringing your own domain name and SSL/TLS certificate to the ALB.
