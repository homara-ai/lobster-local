  ⎿  Listed directory tests/
  ⎿  Listed directory tests/unit/tools/

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to analyze the project's test coverage, specifically focusing on the tests/unit/tools/ directory 
  which appears to be missing tests for various tool files. I need to:

  1. First understand the current state of the testing structure
  2. Identify what tool files exist that need tests
  3. Plan a comprehensive approach to create the missing tests
  4. Suggest using multiple subagents to handle this efficiently

  Since I'm in plan mode, I should:
  1. Examine the current test structure
  2. Look at the tools directory to see what files need testing
  3. Analyze existing test patterns to understand the testing conventions
  4. Create a comprehensive plan
  5. Use the ExitPlanMode tool to present the plan

  Let me start by exploring the current test structure and the tools that need testing.

⏺ I'll analyze your testing structure and create a comprehensive plan for writing missing unit tests for the tools
  directory. Let me first examine the current state of your tests and the tools that need coverage.

⏺ Bash(find /Users/tyo/GITHUB/lobster -name "tests" -type d)
  ⎿  /Users/tyo/GITHUB/lobster/tests

  Now let me examine the current test structure in the main tests directory.

⏺ Bash(ls -la /Users/tyo/GITHUB/lobster/tests/)

  Now let me examine the tools directory in the main codebase to see what tools need tests:

⏺ Bash(ls -la /Users/tyo/GITHUB/lobster/lobster/tools/)

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me check what test files already exist in the tests/unit/tools directory:

⏺ Bash(ls -la /Users/tyo/GITHUB/lobster/tests/unit/tools/)
  ⎿  total 8

  Now let me check the providers subdirectory in tools:

⏺ Bash(ls -la /Users/tyo/GITHUB/lobster/lobster/tools/providers/)
  ⎿  total 248

     … +7 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me also check what test patterns already exist by looking at an existing test file to understand the testing 
  conventions:

⏺ Read(tests/unit/services/test_clustering_service.py)
  ⎿  Read 981 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me check another existing test pattern to understand testing conventions better:

⏺ Read(tests/unit/services/test_preprocessing_service.py)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me examine the mock data structure to understand the testing framework better:

⏺ Read(tests/mock_data/base.py)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me examine some of the tools that need testing by looking at their structure:

⏺ Read(lobster/tools/bulk_rnaseq_service.py)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check what exists in the test_cases.json to understand the test patterns:

⏺ Read(tests/test_cases.json)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me also look at what test files are already in the services folder to understand which have been completed:

⏺ Bash(ls -la /Users/tyo/GITHUB/lobster/tests/unit/services/)
  ⎿  total 528

     drwxr-xr-x   8 tyo  staff    256 Sep 12 01:01 ..
     … +8 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the situation. Let me analyze all the tools that need tests and create
   a comprehensive plan.

  From my analysis, I can see:

  1. Existing Test Structure: The project has a well-established testing framework with sophisticated mock data, 
  fixtures, and testing patterns. Tests are organized by category (unit, integration, system, performance) and use 
  professional testing practices.
  2. Current Test Coverage in Services: They already have tests for:
    - clustering_service.py ✅
    - geo_service.py ✅
    - preprocessing_service.py ✅
    - proteomics_visualization_service.py ✅
    - providers (pubmed_provider.py, geo_provider.py, etc.) ✅
    - quality_service.py ✅
    - visualization_service.py ✅
  3. Missing Test Files for Tools: Looking at the lobster/tools/ directory, these files need unit tests but are missing 
  from tests/unit/tools/:
    - bulk_rnaseq_service.py ❌
    - differential_formula_service.py ❌
    - enhanced_singlecell_service.py ❌
    - file_upload_service.py ❌
    - geo_downloader.py ❌
    - geo_fallback_service.py ❌
    - geo_parser.py ❌
    - handoff_tool.py ❌
    - ml_proteomics_service_ALPHA.py ❌
    - ml_transcriptomics_service_ALPHA.py ❌
    - pipeline_strategy.py ❌
    - proteomics_analysis_service.py ❌
    - proteomics_differential_service.py ❌
    - proteomics_preprocessing_service.py ❌
    - proteomics_quality_service.py ❌
    - pseudobulk_service.py ❌
    - publication_service.py ❌

  I'll focus on identifying the two newly added services that require comprehensive test coverage. These services need 
  thorough examination to ensure they meet the project's rigorous testing standards. I'll prioritize creating detailed 
  test suites that cover all potential scenarios, edge cases, and potential failure modes for pseudobulk_service.py and 
  publication_service.py.

✻ Thinking…

  Great! The user has approved my plan. Now I need to start implementing it by launching the 4 subagents in parallel to 
  create all the missing test files. Let me first create a todo list to track this large undertaking, then launch all 
  the agents in parallel.

  Based on my plan, I need to:

  1. Create a todo list tracking the 17 test files across 4 agent groups
  2. Launch all 4 agents in parallel with detailed instructions for each group
  3. Each agent will create comprehensive test files following the established patterns

  Let me start with the TodoWrite tool to track progress, then launch all agents in parallel as requested.

⏺ Perfect! Now I'll execute the comprehensive test writing plan using multiple parallel subagents. Let me first
  create a todo list to track this major undertaking, then launch all 4 agents simultaneously.

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to update the first 4 todos to "in_progress" and launch all 4 agents in parallel. I'll first mark the first
   4 as in_progress, then launch all agents in a single message with multiple tool calls as requested.

✻ Thinking…

  Now I'll launch all 4 agents in parallel using a single message with multiple Task tool calls as requested. This will 
  maximize efficiency by having all agents work simultaneously on their respective test file groups.

⏺ Now I'll launch all 4 specialized agents in parallel to create comprehensive test coverage for the missing tools:

✻ Thinking…

  The agents hit token limits and didn't complete. This is a common issue when trying to generate very large files 
  through agents. I need to adjust my approach and create the test files directly since the comprehensive test files 
  they were supposed to create would be very large.

  Let me update the todo list to reflect that the agent approach didn't work due to output limitations, and then create 
  the test files myself more strategically - focusing on one at a time rather than trying to do everything in parallel.

⏺ I see the agents hit output token limits trying to generate comprehensive test files. Let me adjust the approach
  and create these test files directly, focusing on one at a time to ensure quality and completeness.

✻ Thinking…

  The agents hit token limits because I was asking them to create comprehensive test files that would be 800-1000 lines 
  each. That's too much output for a single agent response. Let me adjust my approach and create the test files myself, 
  starting with the most important ones first.

  Let me start by examining the first service I need to test to understand its structure and methods.

⏺ The agents exceeded output limits trying to generate comprehensive test files. Let me create these test files
  directly, starting with the most critical services. I'll begin with the bulk RNA-seq service:

✻ Thinking…

  I need to first examine the BulkRNASeqService to understand its methods and structure before creating comprehensive 
  tests. Let me read the source file to understand what I need to test.

⏺ Read(lobster/tools/bulk_rnaseq_service.py)
  ⎿  Read 150 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I can see the BulkRNASeqService has several methods I need to test. Let me continue reading to understand the full 
  structure and then create comprehensive tests. I'll need to see more of the methods to understand what I need to test.

⏺ Search(pattern: "def \w+\(self", path: "lobster/tools/bulk_rnaseq_service.py", output_mode: "content")

  ⎿  Found 53 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I can see the full API of the BulkRNASeqService. I need to create comprehensive tests for all these methods. Let 
  me start creating the test file with a structure that follows the established patterns in the project.

⏺ Write(tests/unit/tools/test_bulk_rnaseq_service.py)

✻ Thinking…

  Great! I've created a comprehensive test file for the BulkRNASeqService. Now let me update the todo list and move on 
  to the next service. Let me continue with the DifferentialFormulaService.

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me read the DifferentialFormulaService to understand its API and create comprehensive tests for it.

✻ Thinking…

  Now I can see the full API. The DifferentialFormulaService is focused on R-style formula parsing and design matrix 
  construction. Let me create comprehensive tests for this service.

⏺ Write(tests/unit/tools/test_differential_formula_service.py)
  ⎿  Error writing file

✻ Thinking…

  I need to create a new file, not modify an existing one, so I don't need to read it first.

⏺ Write(tests/unit/tools/test_differential_formula_service.py)
  ⎿  Error writing file

✻ Thinking…

  I can't write to a file that doesn't exist using the Write tool. I got the error that the file has not been read yet. 
  Let me create this file correctly.

  I see there's already a test file for the differential formula service! It looks comprehensive and professionally 
  written. Let me check if there are any other existing test files in the tools directory.

  Great! I can see there are already several test files present in the tools directory that I didn't know about:

  1. test_bulk_rnaseq_pydeseq2.py - PyDESeq2 specific tests
  2. test_bulk_rnaseq_service.py - Bulk RNA-seq service tests (this one I just created)
  3. test_differential_formula_service.py - Formula service tests (already exists!)
  4. test_file_upload_service.py - File upload service tests (already exists!)
  5. test_pseudobulk_service.py - Pseudobulk service tests (already exists!)

  Let me update my todo list to reflect the current status and identify what still needs to be created. I should check 
  which tools still need tests.

✻ Thinking…

  Excellent! I can see that several test files already exist. Let me continue with creating the missing ones. I'll focus
   on the proteomics tests next since those are important. Let me start with test_proteomics_analysis_service.py.

✻ Thinking…

  Let me first examine the ProteomicsAnalysisService to understand its structure and methods.

✻ Thinking…

  Now I can see the full API of the ProteomicsAnalysisService. It has methods for:
  1. Statistical testing with missing value handling
  2. Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP-like)
  3. Clustering analysis (K-means, hierarchical, Gaussian mixture)
  4. Pathway enrichment analysis

  Let me create comprehensive tests for this service.
