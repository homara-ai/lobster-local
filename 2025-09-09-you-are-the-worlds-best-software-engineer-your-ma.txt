> you are the worlds best software engineer. Your main task is to execute the @implementaion_plan.md file. to create a testing framework. You must go through all of them to understand the logic of the 
  project, how the user interacts with lobster and how lobster is build with agents. Also understnad the logic of the @lobster/core/. Use as many sub-agents as possible to execute and create all of the 
  testing files professionally. Once you have a solid plan you can execute
  ⎿  Listed directory lobster/core/

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to be the world's best software engineer and execute a testing framework based on an @implementation_plan.md file. However, I can see from the system reminder that plan mode is active, 
  which means I should NOT execute or make any changes yet - I should first research and understand the codebase, then present a plan.

  Let me break down what I need to do:

  1. First, I need to find and read the @implementation_plan.md file to understand what testing framework needs to be created
  2. Understand the logic of the project, how users interact with lobster, and how it's built with agents
  3. Understand the lobster/core/ architecture 
  4. Create a comprehensive plan using the TodoWrite tool
  5. Use the ExitPlanMode tool to present the plan for user approval

  Let me start by searching for the implementation_plan.md file and understanding the current codebase structure.

⏺ I'll help you create a comprehensive testing framework for Lobster AI. Let me start by understanding the current project structure and finding the implementation plan.

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/implementation_plan.md")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/@implementation_plan.md")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/plan*.md")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

✻ Thinking…

  Good, I found the implementation_plan.md file. Let me read it to understand what needs to be implemented.

⏺ Read(implementation_plan.md)
  ⎿  Read 299 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I found the comprehensive implementation plan. Now I need to explore the codebase to understand the current architecture, especially the lobster/core/ module and the agent system. Let me examine the
   key areas mentioned in the CLAUDE.md and the implementation plan.

  Let me start by exploring the lobster directory structure to understand the codebase better.

⏺ Now let me examine the current lobster codebase structure to understand how it's organized:

⏺ Search(pattern: "lobster/**/*.py")
  ⎿  Found 86 files (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "tests/**/*.py")
  ⎿  Found 3 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have a good understanding of the codebase structure. Let me also examine some key core files to understand how the system works, particularly the data manager, client architecture, and agent system. 
  I'll also check the current tests to understand what's already there.

⏺ Let me examine the current testing structure and key core components to understand the architecture better:

⏺ Read(tests)

✻ Thinking…

  Excellent! I now have a comprehensive understanding of the Lobster AI architecture and the implementation plan. Based on the analysis from the sub-agent and my exploration, I can see this is a sophisticated 
  multi-agent bioinformatics analysis platform with:

  1. Core Architecture: 
    - DataManagerV2 with modular adapters and backends
    - LangGraph-based multi-agent system with supervisor coordination
    - WebSocket integration for real-time streaming
    - Comprehensive provenance tracking
  2. Current Testing State: 
    - Only 3 test files currently exist (run_integration_tests.py, test_cloud_switching.py, and test_cases.json)
    - Tests are currently failing (100% failure rate due to AWS credential issues)
    - Need comprehensive unit, integration, and system tests
  3. Implementation Plan: 
    - Very detailed 30-step implementation plan over 12 weeks
    - Covers all aspects: unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, system tests
    - Includes mock data generation, agent testing, service testing
    - Focus on scientific accuracy and reproducibility

  Now I should create a comprehensive implementation plan using TodoWrite and then present it with ExitPlanMode.

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me complete the analysis of the current testing infrastructure and identify gaps by examining the existing tests and architecture patterns. Then I'll present my comprehensive implementation plan.

⏺ Based on my comprehensive analysis of the Lobster AI codebase, I've identified significant gaps in the current testing infrastructure and created a detailed implementation plan.

  Current Testing Infrastructure Analysis

  Existing Tests:
  - tests/run_integration_tests.py - Integration test runner (well-designed but limited coverage)
  - tests/test_cloud_switching.py - Cloud/local client switching tests
  - tests/test_cases.json - 25 test scenarios focused on GEO workflows
  - tests/results.json - Previous test results showing 100% failure rate

  Critical Gaps Identified:

  1. Missing Unit Tests - Zero unit tests for core components (DataManagerV2, adapters, backends, agents)
  2. No Service Layer Tests - Bioinformatics services (GEO, preprocessing, clustering) lack validation
  3. Agent System Untested - No testing of individual agents or multi-agent coordination
  4. No Mock Infrastructure - All tests depend on external APIs, causing failures
  5. Missing Performance Tests - No benchmarking for large dataset processing
  6. No Error Handling Tests - System resilience and recovery untested

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p /Users/tyo/GITHUB/lobster/tests/unit/core /Users/tyo/GITHUB/lobster/tests/unit/agents /Users/tyo/GITHUB/lobster/tests/unit/tools /Users/tyo/GITHUB/lobs…)
  ⎿  (No content)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me create init.py files for the test packages and then start with the most critical test - the DataManagerV2 comprehensive test.

⏺ Write(tests/unit/__init__.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to tests/unit/__init__.py
     # Unit tests package

⏺ Write(tests/unit/core/__init__.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to tests/unit/core/__init__.py
     # Core component unit tests

⏺ Write(tests/unit/agents/__init__.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to tests/unit/agents/__init__.py
     # Agent unit tests

⏺ Write(tests/unit/tools/__init__.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to tests/unit/tools/__init__.py
     # Tools unit tests

⏺ Write(tests/integration/__init__.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to tests/integration/__init__.py
     # Integration tests

⏺ Write(tests/system/__init__.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to tests/system/__init__.py
     # System tests

⏺ Write(tests/performance/__init__.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to tests/performance/__init__.py
     # Performance tests

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me update the todo list to mark the directory creation as completed and start implementing the DataManagerV2 tests.

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to implement the comprehensive DataManagerV2 tests. Let me first examine the DataManagerV2 class to understand its methods and structure better.

⏺ Now I'll implement the comprehensive DataManagerV2 tests. Let me first examine the DataManagerV2 structure to ensure complete coverage:

⏺ Read(lobster/core/data_manager_v2.py)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me get more of the DataManagerV2 class to understand all the methods I need to test:

⏺ Task(Analyze DataManagerV2 methods)
  ⎿  Done (1 tool use · 52.6k tokens · 1m 36.0s)                                                                                                                                                            

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the DataManagerV2 class. Let me implement comprehensive unit tests that cover all the critical functionality and achieve the 95% coverage target.

⏺ Now I'll implement comprehensive unit tests for DataManagerV2 based on the detailed analysis:
  ⎿  API Error: Claude's response exceeded the 8096 output token maximum. To configure this behavior, set the CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS environment variable.

> please continue

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to continue implementing the comprehensive testing framework. I'm currently working on implementing tests/unit/core/test_data_manager_v2.py with comprehensive DataManagerV2 tests, which is 
  marked as "in_progress" in my todo list.

  Based on the detailed analysis I received from the sub-agent about DataManagerV2, I should now create comprehensive unit tests that cover all the major functionality categories:

  1. Core initialization & setup
  2. Backend & adapter management  
  3. Modality management lifecycle
  4. Quality & validation
  5. Workspace management
  6. Plot management
  7. Legacy compatibility
  8. Machine learning integration
  9. Export & documentation
  10. Error handling patterns

  I should create a comprehensive test file that achieves 95% coverage of the DataManagerV2 class.
  ⎿  API Error: Claude's response exceeded the 8096 output token maximum. To configure this behavior, set the CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS environment variable.
