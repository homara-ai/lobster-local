# Getting Started with Lobster AI

Welcome to Lobster AI! This quick start guide will have you analyzing bioinformatics data in minutes.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+** (Python 3.12+ recommended)
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **LLM Provider** (choose one):
  - [Claude API Key](https://console.anthropic.com/) (Recommended - simpler setup)
  - [AWS Bedrock Access](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) (For AWS users)
- **NCBI API Key** (optional, for enhanced literature search)

### 2. One-Command Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/homara-ai/lobster.git
cd lobster
make install
```

This command will:
- âœ… Verify your Python installation
- âœ… Create a virtual environment
- âœ… Install all dependencies
- âœ… Set up configuration files
- âœ… Display next steps

### 3. Configure API Keys

Edit the `.env` file created during installation:

```bash
nano .env
```

Add your API keys (choose ONE provider):
```env
# Option 1: Claude API (Recommended for simplicity)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxx

# Option 2: AWS Bedrock (For AWS users)
AWS_BEDROCK_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-access-key
AWS_BEDROCK_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-key

# Optional: Force a specific provider (auto-detected by default)
# LOBSTER_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic  # or "bedrock"

# Optional (enhances literature search)
NCBI_API_KEY=your-ncbi-api-key-here
```

### 4. Activate & Test

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Test installation
lobster --help

# Start interactive mode
lobster chat
```

### 5. Your First Analysis

Try this example in the chat interface:

```
ðŸ¦ž You: Download and analyze GSE109564 from GEO database

ðŸ¦ž Lobster: I'll download and analyze this single-cell RNA-seq dataset for you...

[Downloads data and performs quality control, filtering, clustering, and marker gene analysis]
```

## What Can Lobster Do?

### Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis
- Quality control and filtering
- Normalization and scaling
- Clustering (Leiden algorithm)
- Marker gene identification
- Cell type annotation
- Trajectory analysis

### Bulk RNA-seq Analysis
- Differential expression with pyDESeq2
- Complex experimental design support
- Batch effect correction
- Pathway enrichment analysis

### Proteomics Analysis
- Mass spectrometry data processing
- Missing value pattern analysis
- Statistical testing with FDR control
- Protein network analysis
- Affinity proteomics (Olink panels)

### Multi-Omics Integration
- Cross-platform data integration
- Joint clustering and analysis
- Correlation network analysis
- Integrated visualization

### Literature Mining
- Automatic parameter extraction from publications
- PubMed literature search
- GEO dataset discovery
- Method validation against published results

## Essential Commands

Once in the chat interface (`lobster chat`), try these commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show all available commands |
| `/status` | Display system status and health |
| `/files` | List files in your workspace |
| `/data` | Show current datasets |
| `/plots` | List generated visualizations |
| `/read <file>` | Display file contents |
| `/export` | Export complete analysis |

## Example Workflows

### Quick Dataset Analysis
```
ðŸ¦ž You: Load my_data.csv as single-cell RNA-seq data and perform standard analysis
```

### Literature-Guided Analysis
```
ðŸ¦ž You: Find optimal clustering parameters for my single-cell data based on recent publications
```

### Multi-Dataset Integration
```
ðŸ¦ž You: Load GSE12345 and GSE67890, then compare their cell populations
```

### Custom Analysis
```
ðŸ¦ž You: Perform differential expression between clusters 2 and 5 using a negative binomial model
```

## Getting Help

- **Type `/help`** in the chat for command reference
- **Check `/status`** to verify system health
- **Use `/files`** to see what data is available
- **Try `/dashboard`** for system overview
