## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: High Missing Values in MS Data
```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "My MS data has >60% missing values - is this normal?"
```
**Solution**: Normal for MS data. Use appropriate MNAR imputation and consider protein filtering strategies.

### Issue 2: Poor Sample Correlations
```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Sample correlations are below 0.7 - what should I check?"
```
**Solution**: Check for batch effects, sample degradation, or technical issues. Consider outlier removal.

### Issue 3: Low Protein Coverage
```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "I'm only detecting 500 proteins in my MS experiment"
```
**Solution**: Check sample preparation, LC-MS settings, and database search parameters.

### Issue 4: Olink QC Failures
```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Several Olink samples failed quality control"
```
**Solution**: Check sample integrity, pipetting accuracy, and plate effects.

## Best Practices

### MS Proteomics
1. **Missing Values**: Use MNAR-appropriate imputation for low-abundance proteins
2. **Normalization**: Apply median centering before statistical testing
3. **Filtering**: Remove proteins with <50% valid values across samples
4. **Statistics**: Use empirical Bayes methods for small sample sizes

### Affinity Proteomics
1. **Quality Control**: Monitor CV values and detection frequencies
2. **Antibody Validation**: Check antibody performance metrics regularly
3. **Technical Replicates**: Include technical replicates for CV assessment
4. **Cross-Platform**: Validate findings across multiple panels when possible

### Multi-Omics Integration
1. **Sample Matching**: Ensure proper sample correspondence across platforms
2. **Timing**: Account for different extraction and processing times
3. **Normalization**: Use platform-appropriate normalization methods
4. **Interpretation**: Consider biological vs technical correlations
