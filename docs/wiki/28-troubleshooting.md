**Solutions:**

#### Check Python Version
```bash
# Verify Python version (requires 3.12+)
python --version

# If using wrong version, create conda environment
conda create -n lobster python=3.12
conda activate lobster
```

#### Clean Installation
```bash
# Remove existing installation
pip uninstall lobster-ai

# Clean install with development dependencies
git clone https://github.com/homara-ai/lobster.git
cd lobster
make clean-install
```

#### Resolve Dependency Conflicts
```bash
