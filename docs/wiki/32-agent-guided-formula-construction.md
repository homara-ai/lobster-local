**Usage:**
```python
suggest_formula_for_design(
    pseudobulk_modality="my_data_pseudobulk",
    analysis_goal="Compare treatment vs control",  # Optional
    show_metadata_summary=True
)
```

**What it does:**
- Examines metadata structure and variable types

**Usage:**
```python
construct_de_formula_interactive(
    pseudobulk_modality="my_data_pseudobulk",
    main_variable="condition",
    covariates=["batch", "age"],  # Optional
    include_interactions=False,
    validate_design=True
)
```

**What it does:**
- Constructs R-style formula from components
- Validates against metadata structure

"üìä **Formula Design Analysis for 'pbmc_pseudobulk'**

**Metadata Summary:**
‚Ä¢ Samples: 24
‚Ä¢ Variables analyzed: 6
‚Ä¢ Categorical variables: 3
‚Ä¢ Continuous variables: 2

**Key Variables:**
‚Ä¢ **condition**: categorical, 2 levels (treatment, control)
‚Ä¢ **batch**: categorical, 3 levels (batch1, batch2, batch3)
‚Ä¢ **gender**: categorical, 2 levels (M, F)
‚Ä¢ **age**: continuous variable

üìù **Recommended Formula Options:**

**1. Simple Model** *(recommended for Initial exploratory analysis)*
   Formula: `~condition`
   Description: Compare condition groups directly

   ‚úÖ Pros: Controls for technical/batch variation, More reliable effect estimates
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: Reduces degrees of freedom, Requires balanced design
   Min samples needed: 8

**3. Multi-factor Model** *(recommended for Final analysis with adequate samples)*
   Formula: `~condition + batch + gender + age`
   Description: Comprehensive model accounting for condition and 3 covariates
   ‚úÖ Pros: Controls for multiple confounders, Publication-ready analysis
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: Requires larger sample size, More complex interpretation
   Min samples needed: 15

üí° **Recommendation**: Start with the simple model for exploration, then use the batch-corrected model if you see batch effects.

**Next step**: Use `construct_de_formula_interactive` to build and validate your chosen formula."

User: "Let's start with the batch-corrected model"

Agent: [Uses construct_de_formula_interactive]
```

### Workflow 2: Iterative Analysis (Step 12 of customer workflow)

```
User: "The results look good, but I want to see what happens if I add gender as a covariate"

- **Iteration Tracking**: Minimal memory footprint, stores only essential data
- **Comparison Operations**: <5 seconds for typical result comparisons

## Agent Interaction Examples

### Example 1: Beginner User

```
User: "I have pseudobulk data and need to find differentially expressed genes"

Agent: "I'll help you set up a proper statistical analysis. Let me first examine your pseudobulk data structure."

[Agent uses suggest_formula_for_design]

Agent: "I've analyzed your data and found you have 36 samples with these key variables:
‚Ä¢ condition: disease (n=18) vs healthy (n=18) - Your main comparison
‚Ä¢ batch: 4 different batches - Important for controlling technical variation
‚Ä¢ age: continuous variable (22-67 years) - Potential biological confounder

I recommend starting with a batch-corrected model: `~condition + batch`
This will compare disease vs healthy while accounting for batch effects.

Should I construct and validate this formula for you?"

User: "Yes, that sounds good"

[Agent uses construct_de_formula_interactive]

Agent: "Formula constructed successfully! The design looks statistically sound with 36 samples and 5 coefficients, giving you good power to detect medium to large effects.

Ready to run the analysis?"
```

### Example 2: Iterative Refinement

```
User: "The analysis found 342 significant genes. Can we try adding age as a covariate?"

Agent: "Great idea! Adding age can help control for age-related expression changes. Let me run this as iteration 2 and compare with your previous results."

[Agent uses iterate_de_analysis]

Agent: "Iteration 2 complete with formula: `~condition + batch + age`

Results: 387 significant genes (vs 342 previously)
‚Ä¢ 298 genes overlap with previous analysis (87% concordance)
‚Ä¢ 89 new genes became significant
‚Ä¢ 44 genes lost significance

The high overlap suggests consistent core biology, while the new genes likely represent age-sensitive disease effects that were previously masked.

Age appears to explain meaningful variance - I recommend keeping this model."
```

### Example 3: Model Selection

```
User: "I want to compare the simple model vs the full model to see which is better"

Agent: [Uses compare_de_iterations automatically]

Agent: "üìä **Model Comparison: Simple vs Full**

**Simple Model** (~condition):
‚Ä¢ 456 significant genes
‚Ä¢ Higher statistical power
‚Ä¢ Clear biological interpretation

**Full Model** (~condition + batch + age + gender):
‚Ä¢ 298 significant genes
‚Ä¢ More conservative results
‚Ä¢ Controls for multiple confounders

**Overlap Analysis:**
‚Ä¢ 267 genes significant in both (89% of full model genes)
‚Ä¢ 31 genes unique to full model (high-confidence hits)
‚Ä¢ 189 genes only in simple model (may include false positives)

**Recommendation**: The full model is more conservative and likely more accurate for publication. The 31 genes unique to the full model represent high-confidence discoveries after controlling for confounders."
```

## Best Practices

### Formula Selection Guidelines

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with `~condition` for exploration
2. **Add Batch Correction**: Use `~condition + batch` for multi-batch data
3. **Include Biological Covariates**: Add `age`, `gender`, etc. for final analysis
4. **Avoid Overfitting**: Limit to ~1 parameter per 3-4 samples
5. **Validate Design**: Always check warnings and design matrix rank

### Statistical Considerations

- **Minimum Sample Sizes**:
  - Simple model: 6+ samples (3+ per group)
  - Batch-corrected: 8+ samples
  - Multi-factor: 12+ samples

- **Effect Size Detection**:
  - Large effects (>2-fold): Detectable with small samples
  - Medium effects (1.5-fold): Need moderate samples
  - Small effects (<1.5-fold): Require large, well-balanced designs

### Iteration Strategy

1. **Establish Baseline**: Start with simplest reasonable model
2. **Add Complexity Gradually**: Add one covariate at a time
3. **Compare Results**: Use iteration comparison to understand changes
4. **Choose Final Model**: Balance statistical power and biological accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No suitable variables found"**
- Ensure metadata has categorical variables with 2+ levels
- Check that variables aren't all unique (e.g., sample IDs)
- Verify sufficient replication per group

**"Design matrix is rank deficient"**
- Variables may be perfectly correlated
- Remove redundant variables
- Check for batch/condition confounding

**"Few significant genes found"**
- Try simpler model for more power
- Check if batch correction is too aggressive
- Verify biological signal exists in data

**"Too many significant genes"**
- Add covariates to control confounders
- Increase log fold change threshold
- Check for technical artifacts

### Error Recovery

The agent provides context-aware error recovery:

```
Agent: "‚ùå **Formula Construction Failed**

**Formula**: `~condition + nonexistent_variable`
**Error**: Variables not found in metadata: ['nonexistent_variable']

üí° **Suggestions**:
‚Ä¢ Check variable names are spelled correctly
‚Ä¢ Available variables: condition, batch, age, gender, cell_type
‚Ä¢ Try: `construct_de_formula_interactive('my_data', 'condition', ['batch'])`"
```

```

## Statistical Education Features

The agent provides educational context for statistical concepts:

### Formula Complexity Explanations

**Simple Model (`~condition`)**:
- "This compares your groups directly without adjusting for other factors"
- "Best statistical power but may miss important confounders"
- "Good for initial exploration or when you're confident there are no batch effects"

**Batch-Corrected (`~condition + batch`)**:
- "This accounts for technical variation between batches while testing your condition"
- "More reliable estimates but uses some statistical power for batch correction"
- "Recommended when you have multiple batches or processing dates"

**Multi-Factor (`~condition + batch + age + gender`)**:
- "This comprehensive model controls for multiple biological and technical factors"
- "Most accurate for publication but requires larger sample sizes"
- "Each covariate 'uses up' some of your statistical power"

### Design Matrix Education

The agent explains what design matrices represent:

```
"üìà **Design Matrix Preview**:
This shows how your samples are encoded for statistical analysis:
‚Ä¢ Each row = one sample
‚Ä¢ Each column = one statistical parameter
‚Ä¢ Values of 1 mean 'this parameter applies to this sample'
‚Ä¢ Values of 0 mean 'this parameter doesn't apply'

For example, 'condition[T.treatment]' = 1 for treatment samples, 0 for controls."
```
