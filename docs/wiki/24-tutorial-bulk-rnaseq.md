This comprehensive tutorial demonstrates how to perform bulk RNA-seq differential expression analysis using Lobster AI with pyDESeq2 integration, formula-based experimental design, and publication-ready results.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn to:
- Load and process bulk RNA-seq count matrices
- Design complex experimental formulas using R-style syntax
- Perform differential expression analysis with pyDESeq2
- Handle batch effects and complex designs

## Prerequisites

- Lobster AI installed and configured (see [Installation Guide](../INSTALLATION.md))
- API keys set up in your `.env` file
- Understanding of experimental design concepts
- Familiarity with RNA-seq data formats

## Tutorial Dataset

We'll use **GSE123456** (example dataset), a bulk RNA-seq experiment with:
- 24 samples (12 treatment, 12 control)
- 2 batches (sequencing runs)
- 2 time points (early, late response)
- ~20,000 genes quantified
- Complex design: `~condition + batch + time + condition:time`

## Step 1: Starting Your Analysis

Start Lobster AI and prepare for bulk RNA-seq analysis:

```bash
# Start Lobster AI with enhanced CLI

Ready for bulk RNA-seq differential expression analysis!
```

## Step 2: Data Loading and Inspection

Load your bulk RNA-seq count matrix and sample metadata:

```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Load the bulk RNA-seq count matrix from counts.csv and sample metadata from metadata.csv. The data has treatment vs control samples with batch effects."
```

**Expected Output:**
```
ðŸ¦ž Lobster: I'll load your bulk RNA-seq data and inspect the experimental design...

âœ“ Loaded count matrix: 24 samples Ã— 19,847 genes
âœ“ Loaded sample metadata with experimental factors
âœ“ Detected design factors: condition, batch, time_point
âœ“ Count matrix format validated (integer counts)
âœ“ Sample-metadata correspondence verified
âœ“ Stored as modality: 'bulk_rnaseq_counts'

Experimental Design Summary:
- Conditions: treatment (n=12), control (n=12)
- Batches: batch1 (n=12), batch2 (n=12)
- Time points: early (n=12), late (n=12)
- Design matrix: 24 samples Ã— 4 conditions
- Balanced design: âœ“ (equal samples per group)
```

**Inspect the loaded data:**
```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "/data"
```

Shows dataset overview including sample counts, design factors, and data quality metrics.

## Step 3: Quality Control Assessment

Assess data quality and detect potential issues:

```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Perform quality control analysis including sample correlation, batch effect detection, and count distribution assessment"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
ðŸ¦ž Lobster: I'll perform comprehensive quality control for your bulk RNA-seq data...

âœ“ Sample correlation analysis completed
âœ“ Batch effect assessment performed
âœ“ Count distribution analysis finished

Quality Control Results:
- Library sizes: 15.2M - 28.7M counts (good range)
- Sample correlations: 0.85 - 0.98 (excellent)
- Batch effect detected: MODERATE (batch explains 12% variance)
- Low-count genes: 3,247 genes (< 10 counts total)
- Recommended filtering: Remove genes with < 1 CPM in < 3 samples
- Overall data quality: EXCELLENT
```

**Generated QC visualizations:**
```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "/plots"
```

## Step 4: Experimental Design and Formula Construction

Create the design matrix using R-style formulas:

```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Create a design matrix using the formula ~condition + batch + time_point + condition:time_point to model treatment effects, batch effects, and time-dependent responses"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
ðŸ¦ž Lobster: I'll construct the design matrix using your experimental formula...

âœ“ Formula parsed: ~condition + batch + time_point + condition:time_point
âœ“ Design matrix constructed: 24 samples Ã— 6 coefficients
âœ“ Factor levels identified and ordered
âœ“ Interaction terms calculated

âœ“ Contrast matrix prepared for hypothesis testing

Design Matrix Structure:
- Intercept: baseline (control, batch1, early)
- conditiontreatment: main treatment effect
- batchbatch2: batch correction term
- time_pointlate: main time effect
- conditiontreatment:time_pointlate: treatmentÃ—time interaction
- Full rank: âœ“ (all contrasts estimable)

Available Contrasts:
1. Treatment vs Control (main effect)
2. Early vs Late response (time effect)

ðŸ¦ž Lobster: I'll run differential expression analysis using pyDESeq2...

âœ“ pyDESeq2 analysis initialized with design formula
âœ“ Size factor normalization completed
âœ“ Dispersion estimation finished (gene-wise and fitted)
âœ“ Statistical testing performed for specified contrasts

```

**Expected Output:**
```
ðŸ¦ž Lobster: I'll test additional biological contrasts using the fitted model...

âœ“ Custom contrast matrices constructed
âœ“ Statistical tests performed for each contrast

## Step 10: Advanced Analysis Options

### Gene Set Analysis with Custom Gene Lists

```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Perform gene set enrichment analysis using custom gene sets from literature - analyze if our treatment signature overlaps with known drug response signatures"
```

### Temporal Analysis

```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Create temporal expression profiles showing how gene expression changes over time for both treatment and control conditions"
```

### Batch Effect Correction

```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Apply ComBat batch correction and re-run the differential expression analysis to compare results with and without batch correction"
```

### Integration with External Databases

```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Query the Connectivity Map (CMap) database to identify potential drug compounds that could reverse our treatment signature"
```

## Working with Complex Designs

### Multi-Factor Experiments

For experiments with multiple factors (e.g., treatment, time, cell type):

```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Design a three-way interaction model: ~treatment * time * celltype with proper contrast specification"
```

### Paired Sample Analysis

For paired/matched sample designs:

```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Analyze paired samples using the formula ~patient + condition to account for patient-specific effects"
```

### Time Series Analysis

For temporal experiments with multiple time points:

```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Model time as a continuous variable and identify genes with linear, quadratic, or cubic temporal patterns"
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Low Count Genes
```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Many genes have very low counts - should I filter them?"
```
**Solution**: Filter genes with < 1 CPM in < 3 samples (or minimum group size).

### Issue 2: Batch Effects Too Strong
```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Batch effects are overwhelming the biological signal"
```
**Solution**: Use RUVSeq or sva for batch correction, or include batch as blocking factor.

### Issue 3: No Significant Genes
```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "My analysis found no significantly DE genes"
```
**Solution**: Check sample sizes, effect sizes, and consider less stringent FDR thresholds.

### Issue 4: Design Matrix Issues
```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Getting 'matrix not full rank' error"
```
**Solution**: Check for confounded factors or redundant terms in the design.

## Best Practices

1. **Sample Size**: Minimum n=3 per group, preferably nâ‰¥6 for robust results
2. **Quality Control**: Always inspect data before analysis
3. **Multiple Testing**: Use FDR correction for genome-wide testing
4. **Effect Size**: Report fold changes with statistical significance
5. **Validation**: Validate key findings with qRT-PCR or independent datasets
6. **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of analysis parameters

## Integration with Other Analyses

### Convert to Single-Cell Format
```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Simulate single-cell data from bulk RNA-seq for method comparison"
```

### Meta-Analysis
```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Combine my results with published datasets for meta-analysis"
```

### Proteomics Integration
```bash
ðŸ¦ž You: "Compare my RNA-seq results with proteomics data from the same experiment"
```
