- ✅ Pure Python DESeq2 integration (pyDESeq2)
- ✅ R-style formula parsing and design matrices

**Remaining Minor Gaps:**

## Workflow Steps Assessment

### Step 1: "I have an anndata object containing the sparse gene counts for the samples of interest"
**Status: ✅ SOLVABLE**

**Reasoning:** Excellent support through DataManagerV2 architecture
- ✅ Native AnnData and sparse matrix handling
- ✅ Professional memory management for large datasets  
- ✅ Multiple format support (H5AD, MTX, CSV, 10X Genomics)
- ✅ Comprehensive validation and quality control
- ✅ Backed mode support for memory-efficient processing

**Implementation Details:**
- `DataManagerV2` provides centralized AnnData storage with modality-based architecture
- `TranscriptomicsAdapter` handles schema-driven validation and multiple input formats
- Comprehensive sparse matrix support with accurate memory tracking
- H5AD backend with compression and integrity validation

---

### Step 2: "I train an embedding of the samples of interest, e.g. using scVI"
**Status: ❌ UNSOLVABLE (with current dependencies)**

**Reasoning:** No deep learning embedding capabilities
- ❌ scvi-tools not in dependencies
- ❌ No PyTorch/TensorFlow integration
- ❌ No variational autoencoder implementations
- ✅ Traditional PCA embeddings available (limited alternative)

**Gap Analysis:**
- Missing scvi-tools dependency in `pyproject.toml`
- No deep learning frameworks for training neural network embeddings
- Current system uses classical PCA-based dimensionality reduction only

---

### Step 3: "I perform clustering on the latent space"
**Status: ⚠️ UNSURE (depends on Step 2)**

**Reasoning:** Good clustering infrastructure, wrong input space
- ✅ Leiden clustering with resolution parameters
- ✅ Neighborhood graph construction
- ✅ Quality metrics and validation
- ❌ Currently operates on PCA space, not deep learning latents

**Current Implementation:** 
- `ClusteringService` provides Leiden clustering via scanpy
- Resolution parameter adjustment (0.1-2.0 range)
- Conditional solvability IF scVI integration is added

---

### Step 4: "I inspect the clusters visually (e.g. by transforming the latent space to a 2D projection and visualizing)"
**Status: ✅ SOLVABLE**

**Reasoning:** Excellent visualization capabilities
- ✅ Interactive UMAP/t-SNE/PCA projections with Plotly
- ✅ Cluster coloring and visualization
- ✅ Scalable visualization (1K-50K+ cells)

---

### Step 6: "If some clusters express multiple marker genes or otherwise appear to belong to multiple groups, I return to step 3 with a new clustering resolution"
**Status: ⚠️ UNSURE**

**Reasoning:** Manual workflow supported, automated detection missing
- ✅ Resolution parameter adjustment capabilities
- ✅ Marker gene analysis for cluster validation
- ✅ Iterative clustering possible
- ❌ No automated detection of ambiguous clusters
- ❌ No automated resolution optimization

**Gap Analysis:**
- Test infrastructure exists for `optimize_leiden_resolution()` but implementation incomplete

- Manual workaround possible but requires user intervention

---

### Step 7: "I assign each cluster to a named cell type or to 'Debris', sometimes collapsing multiple clusters into the same cell type"
**Status: ⚠️ UNSURE**

**Reasoning:** Automated annotation exists, manual control limited

**Status: ❌ UNSOLVABLE (currently)**

**Reasoning:** Basic design capability, no covariate support
- ⚠️ Basic two-group comparison available

**Status: ✅ SOLVABLE**

**Reasoning:** Well-implemented volcano plot system
- ✅ Interactive volcano plots with Plotly
- ✅ Hover information (gene names, fold changes, p-values)
- ✅ Customizable thresholds and styling
- ✅ Professional publication-quality output
- ✅ Both proteomics and bulk RNA-seq implementations

**Implementation Details:**
