# üö® URGENT: Lobster AI Tools Testing - Critical Action Items

**Status:** üî¥ **RELEASE BLOCKED** - Immediate action required
**Current Coverage:** 4% (Target: 85%+)
**Test Pass Rate:** 65.4% (Target: 90%+)

---

## üî• **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (THIS WEEK)**

### **1. Fix Blocking Service Failures**
- [ ] **PseudobulkService KeyError** - Fix 'aggregation_stats' metadata handling
- [ ] **DifferentialFormulaService** - Fix design matrix coefficient counting
- [ ] **BulkRNASeqService** - Update test expectations for markdown formatting

### **2. Create Tests for Core Services (CRITICAL)**
- [ ] `preprocessing_service.py` - 304 lines, 0% coverage
- [ ] `quality_service.py` - 155 lines, 0% coverage
- [ ] `clustering_service.py` - 279 lines, 0% coverage
- [ ] `enhanced_singlecell_service.py` - 284 lines, 0% coverage

**These services process user data - ANY bugs could corrupt scientific results**

---

## üö® **NEXT 2 WEEKS**

### **3. Fix Proteomics Suite (Complete Failure)**
- [ ] All 150+ proteomics tests are failing across 5 services
- [ ] 0% coverage for entire proteomics analysis pipeline
- [ ] Missing value handling, statistical methods, visualizations all broken

### **4. Fix PyDESeq2 Integration**
- [ ] Statistical methods use simplified t-tests instead of proper DESeq2
- [ ] Result formats don't match standard DESeq2 output
- [ ] No validation against R/Bioconductor benchmarks

## üéØ **SUCCESS METRICS**

| **Metric** | **Current** | **Target** | **Deadline** |
|-----------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Overall Coverage | 4% | 85%+ | 8 weeks |
| Test Pass Rate | 65.4% | 90%+ | 2 weeks |
| Core Services Coverage | 0% | 90%+ | 4 weeks |
| Proteomics Suite | 0% failing | 85%+ | 6 weeks |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **SCIENTIFIC RISKS**

- **Data Corruption:** Untested preprocessing could corrupt user data
- **Statistical Inaccuracy:** Wrong results = false scientific discoveries
- **Pipeline Failures:** Core services failing breaks analysis workflows
- **Publication Standards:** Current quality insufficient for peer review

---

## üìã **WEEKLY CHECKPOINTS**

### **Week 1:** Fix blocking failures, start core service tests
### **Week 2:** Complete core service coverage, begin proteomics fixes
### **Week 4:** 50% coverage target, integration tests added
### **Week 6:** 75% coverage target, proteomics suite functional
### **Week 8:** 85% coverage target, release readiness review

---

**üö® NO PRODUCTION RELEASE until these critical issues are resolved**

**Next Review:** Weekly progress reports required
**Escalation:** Engineering leadership must be informed of testing gaps
**Resources:** Dedicated testing team needed for accelerated timeline
